# Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A Minor Project build based on Machine Learning.
This Project is coded in Python.
This Project is build using 3 Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
It is split into 6 modules:
Module 1: Data Collection: The dataset is dowloaded from kaggle and uploaded.
Module 2: Data Preproceesing: The data is cleaned to remove any null values and missing values and split into train data(80%) and test data(20%).
Module 3: Feature Extraction: The data is scaled and encoded.
Module 4: Model Building: The Machine Learning Algorithms are loaded into the model.
Module 5: Prediction: The test data is given to this model and accuracy of the model is tested.
Module 6: The Evaluation Metrics is checked inorder to check the working accuracy of the alogorithm given to the model.
